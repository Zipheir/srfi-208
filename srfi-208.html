<h2 id="status">Status</h2>


<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>This SRFI provides procedures that dissect NaN (Not a Number) inexact values.</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>None at present.</p>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

<p>IEEE floating-point numbers have a set of values known as NaNs,
standing for Not A Number.
They are generated by such operations as <code>(/ 0.0 0.0)</code>, the result of which
could be any number whatsoever, and by <code>(flsqrt 0.0)</code> from
SRFI 144, the result of which cannot be any number.
Scheme implementations that conform to R6RS or R7RS use the external representations
<code>+nan.0</code> and <code>-nan.0</code> for NaNs.</p>

<p>In fact, however, there are 2<sup>52</sup> - 1 possible NaN values,
assuming the representation is a binary64 float.  This SRFI makes it possible
to dissect a NaN to see which of these internal representations it corresponds to.</p>

<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>


<p><code>(nan-negative? </code><em>nan</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns <code>#t</code> if the sign bit of <em>nan</em> is 1 and <code>#f</code> otherwise.</p>
<p><code>(nan-quiet? </code><em>nan</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns <code>#t</code> if <em>nan</em> is a quiet NaN, and <code>#f</code> otherwise.
Quiet NaNs are passed through floating-point operations, whereas non-quiet (or signaling) NaNs
may signal a hardware exception, depending on how the CPU's floating-point instructions
have been configured.</p>
<p><code>(nan-payload </code><em>nan</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns the remaining 51 bits of <em>nan</em> as an positive exact integer.</p>
<p><code>(nan= </code><em>nan1 nan2</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns <code>#t</code> if <em>nan1</em> and <em>nan2</em> have the same sign, quiet bit,
and payload; and <code>#f</code> otherwise.</p>
